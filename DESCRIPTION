Description: mirlyn is a package that allows for library size normalization for
  diversity analysis. This package also includes supplementary functions to
  generate taxonomic composition bar graphs and the assignment of ASV names to
  unique and easily referenced identities. The majority of the functions
  included in mirlyn serve to account for the issue of disparity in liblrary
  sizes between amplicon sequencing samples. The variation seen between library
  sizes of different amplicon sequencing samples is not representative of true
  biological variation and requires a normalization technique to allow for
  sample comparison in diversity analysis without inherent bias. While a variety
  of library normalization techniques have been proposed in the literature,
  mirlyn repeatedly rarefies samples to characterize the sequence data lost in
  the random subsampling process. The characterization of variation through
  rarefying allows for the creation of comprehensive computational replicates
  that provide stronger representation of the original biological communities
  while also accounting for differences in library size.
